# COMP2511 Major Project: Loop Mania

[**Link to specification**](https://gitlab.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP2511/21T2/project-specification)

The game world contains a path composed of image tiles which forms a loop. The Character automatically moves clockwise from position to position through this path, starting from the Hero's Castle.

The game world contains buildings, enemies, gold , health potions , and the Character. Enemies will move around the path, and their method of doing so depends on the enemy type.
