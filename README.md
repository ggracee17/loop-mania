# Loop Mania
UNSW COMP2511 21T2 Major Project

A single player RPG similar to "Loop Hero", where the game takes place in a randomly generated world, and the player changes the world by placing cards instead of directly controlling a character.

## Features

The game world contains a path composed of image tiles which forms a loop. The Character automatically moves clockwise from position to position through this path, starting from the Hero's Castle.

The game world contains buildings, enemies, gold , health potions , and the Character. Enemies will move around the path, and their method of doing so depends on the enemy type.
